# Doubly Stochastic Resonance Simulation 
This code runs a simulation on stochastic differential equations with Gaussian noise. The purpose of the project is to plot graphs assesing convergence of the system with different values as inputs. The project is connected to a research paper I am currently working on at UCL.
## To do list:
- [x] Create the algorithm alculating the steps of the Stochastic process
- [ ] Add a section of the code responsible for iterating over different values of noise variance and strength of the coupling.
- [ ] Plot the boundaries between stable and unstable states
