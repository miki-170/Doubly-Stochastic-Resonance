# Doubly Stochastic Resonance

## Description
This project was created for the purposes of my second year research project on doubly stochastic resonance and noise-induced AI. 
Code contains numerical integration of a Stochastic Differential Equation model, examining the behaviour of the system with a periodic forcing.
